# 🔐 Encryption Web App

A simple web application built with Go and the Gin framework that lets you explore and apply classic encryption techniques like Caesar Cipher and Affine Cipher.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Encrypt/Decrypt**: Easily encrypt or decrypt text using classic ciphers.
- 🔢 **Support for Multiple Ciphers**: Includes Caesar Cipher and Affine Cipher.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for quick text encryption and decryption.

## 🔮 Future Work

- 🛡️ **Add More Classic Ciphers**: Implement additional classic ciphers like Vigenère, Playfair, and Hill Cipher.
- 🔑 **Modern Cryptography**: Introduce modern encryption algorithms like RSA, AES, and use a database to store and manage public/private keys.
- 📊 **Database Integration**: Store encrypted texts, keys, and user sessions in a database for persistence and retrieval.
- 🧪 **Testing & Validation**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure the accuracy and security of encryption methods.
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the app accessible to a global audience.
- 🔍 **Cipher Analysis Tools**: Include tools for analyzing cipher strength and vulnerability assessments.
- 💬 **User Authentication**: Add a user authentication system to personalize encryption settings and history.
